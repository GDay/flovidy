== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Does this work with a caching plugin?
A: Yes, it does work with any caching plugin.

Q: Does this work with existing links?
A: Yes, as long as the link has amazon.com or amzn.to in it.

Q: What affiliate programs do you support?
A: All Amazon affiliate programs are supported (including the Australian store).

Q: Do I need Amazon's Onelink or Genius for this to work?
A: No, you do not. This is a completely stand alone plugin that does not require any third parties.

Q: How does this compare to OneLink, AAWP, Genius and others?
A: Check this: https://flovidy.com/comparison-amazon-affilate-link-localizers/

Q: Do you need access to Amazon's API?
A: No, Flovidy does not need access to their API.

Q: Will you lock me in?
A: No, we will not. You can disable or remove the plugin at any time. We do not change your amazon links. The only downside of disabling the plugin is that localizing won't work, of course ;)

Q: Do you support shopping carts?
A: Yes, we do. You can create those by simply adding multiple amazon product urls in one line seperated by a semicolon (';'). E.g: https://amazon.com/dp/bklad123/;https://amazon.com/dp/23244/;https://amazon.com/dp/23423434/

Q: Does this plugin work if I don't fill in a referral code for a different country?
A: It will not work for the countries you don't have a referral code for.

Q: How do you make money from this?
A: This used to be a paid plugin (one time fee). Unfortunately, Amazon built OneLink and Genius has a free plan now. The costs of user acquisition are too high at this point to make a decent ROI on this, even though we believe our plugin is the best in the market. Therefore, we decided to open the plugin up to everyone. Our loss is your gain. We do not take any commission from you, we also do not charge you for using it. It's completely free.

Q: How accurate is your location tracking?
A: We use an open IP database (GeoIP) which is a few years old now. The data in it, is still fairly accurate. Exact numbers are hard to give, but we expect to locate 90%+ correctly.

Q: Where can I ask for support?
A: We can give you limited support through email: hello@flovidy.com. Please note that this plugin is free and that it might take a few days before you get an answer. Customizations to the plugin can be completed for a fee (minimum costs is $50).

Q: How regularly will this plugin be updated?
A: We will do our best to keep it compatible with the latest Wordpress version as well as new amazon affiliate stores. But we cannot promise anything.

Q: Can I have a look at the source code?
A: Yes, you can. The plugin is completely opensource. Feel free to change it however you like.

Q: Is this plugin blocked by ad blockers?
A: No, it is not. The plugin only changes the links based on the visitor's location. It will always be a normal amazon link (with your affiliate code).
